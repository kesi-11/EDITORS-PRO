/// Phase E.20: Cloud sync configuration.

/// This file contains the OAuth2 client IDs for Google Drive sync.
/// The values come from the Google Cloud Console — see
/// `docs/GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP.md` for setup instructions.
///
/// ## Security note
///
/// OAuth2 client IDs for mobile apps are NOT secret — they're shipped
/// in the app binary and can be extracted. This is by design: the
/// security model relies on the OAuth2 PKCE flow + the redirect URI
/// being registered to your app's signing key, not on the client ID
/// being secret. Google's documentation explicitly states that
/// client IDs for installed/mobile apps don't need to be kept
/// confidential.
///
/// See: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/native-app

  ///    and SHA-1 fingerprint (from your signing key)
