//! Dedicated decode thread with channel-based request/response (Phase C.13).
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Previously, `EditorsProEngine::get_frame` ran FFmpeg decode on the
//! calling thread — typically the Flutter UI thread via the FFI dispatcher.
//! At 30 FPS preview, that's 30 sequential FFI calls per second, each
//! blocking on FFmpeg's `decode_frame_at` (which itself does disk I/O,
//! packet demuxing, and H.264 entropy decoding).
//!
//! This module moves decode to a dedicated worker thread. The Flutter
//! side sends a `DecodeRequest` via a `crossbeam_channel::Sender`, and
//! receives a `DecodeResponse` on a oneshot channel. The worker thread
//! owns the `HardwareDecoder` exclusively, eliminating the need for
//! `unsafe impl Send` on FFmpeg contexts (the decoder never leaves the
//! thread that opened it).
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! Flutter UI thread                  Decode worker thread
//! ─────────────────────              ─────────────────────
//!  get_frame(t)         ──req──►     loop {
//!    await oneshot.rx()                  req = rx.recv()
//!    ──────────────────                  match req {
//!    ◄──resp──                            Open(path) => decoder.open(path)
//!                                         Seek(t)    => decoder.decode_frame_at(t)
//!                                         Close      => decoder.close()
//!                                       }
//!                                       tx.send(resp)
//!                                     }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Future: push-based streaming (Phase C.14)
//!
//! The current design is still request-response. Phase C.14 will extend
//! this to push-based streaming, where the worker proactively decodes
//! the next N frames and pushes them via a `flutter_rust_bridge::StreamSink`
//! so the Flutter side can render them without round-trips.
